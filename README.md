## Connecting to iceberg from Windows

You can connect to iceberg through your [web browser](https://myapps.shef.ac.uk/sgd/index.jsp?langSelected=en&SGD_Token=Epc6zWBl1mzYDM~hmN3q51gRAYIEkWvf) by entering your username and password.

Once you have logged in you must log in to a worker node by typing:

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/khmaher/Population-Genomics-Workshop/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/khmaher/Population-Genomics-Workshop/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
